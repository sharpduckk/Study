There were discussions on protocol, security, and news issues. I am the Minister of Unification policy advisor. Let's connect Kim Chang-soo. Hello. Hello, Kim Chang-soo.  Jeong Kwan-yong > I heard that you skipped lunch and discussed it for four hours from 10 to 2. Kim Chang-soo : In order to prepare for the inter-Korean summit, various detailed consultations with the North must be conducted. The working-level talks today are one of them. Jung Kwan-yong > Are there any decisions made today? Kim Chang-soo : Today is the first working-level meeting so far. We had working-level talks on protocol, security, and press coverage. These are very important issues in preparing for a summit with the agenda. We're going to have a few more working-level talks. So I understand that we are not in a position to announce what we have agreed on so far.  Jung Kwan-yong > However, is it decided what time the question begins on April 27? Is that still more to be discussed? Kim Chang-soo : Especially when we have a summit meeting with other countries, we will announce the schedule of the summit meeting in the near future. So it's because of the uniqueness of the summit. It must be about the protocol of the two leaders or security. The summit in the international community is the first such meeting, especially in inter-Korean relations, for the North's highest level. Therefore, it is difficult to agree on, disclose, or do this in advance. It's also a diplomatic practice.  Jeong Kwan-yong > This means that it is only possible to know when it starts. Many media outlets also have speculative reports, and as Kim Jong Un said, we have to come all the way to the South's Peace House. Then they walked down the Military Demarcation Line and our Moon Jae-in, the president to go to the front of the Military Demarcation Line and celebrate what this is how?  Jeong Kwan-yong > There is nothing Kim Chang-soo can say to us today. Regarding the protocol and security of the South-North summit talks today, officials who participated as working-level delegates will closely prepare for the summit. I've only made this presentation so far.  Is the TV broadcast live? Kim Chang-soo TV live broadcasting also talks a lot about live TV broadcasting in the media, but as I mentioned earlier, working talks for the summit will be held two or three more times. In addition to this, we have had two experiences at the summit in 2000 or 2007. In both of these summits, there have been three working-level talks. So I think we can finally make the announcement when we have a working agreement. ◇ Jeong Kwan-yong's details will not be answered even if you ask questions. Kim Chang-soo : Of course. The three issues of denuclearization, peace and improvement of inter-Korean relations are considered important. And the most important thing is denuclearization. Why denuclearization is important is understandable even if we take a brief look at the background of the two summits so far. During the 2000 inter-Korean summit, North Korea and the United States continued to negotiate missiles. Thus, the two Koreas met in 2000 with much progress in their relations. And in 2007, there was a very specific agreement on the North Korean nuclear issue through the six-party talks. Against this backdrop, there was a summit between the two Koreas in 2007. In this case, however, the summit will be held without any contact between North Korea and the United States, with North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities at their most advanced level. Therefore, at this summit, the issue of denuclearization will be the most important issue, and it will affect even the summit between the U.S. and North Korea, which is to be held immediately after the agreement on denuclearization. Kim Chang-soo : Of course. So North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will negotiate denuclearization when the envoys last visited North Korea to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on the issue of denuclearization between the two Koreas. \" We will not conduct nuclear and missile tests, and carry out joint military drills with the U.S. \" Meanwhile, North Korea has been passive in negotiations with the United States over denuclearization, not even with South Korea. This time, however, North Korea changed its stance on denuclearization with South Korea. So the two sides talk about denuclearization at the summit, but they also have to consult with the United States in the end, so we need to come up with a good solution at the summit and talk about denuclearization at the summit. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > In addition, there was talk of how about holding inter-Korean summits on a regular basis, and is that possible? Yes, I do. There are many of those opinions. So far, the summit twice, and Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun government once again once government matters for the implementation of an agreement at the summit because I can't.That such problems.  Jeong Kwan-yong > Kim Chang-soo : Yes. But the media says the summit is a shuttle summit, although the government doesn't use that term. So it means that you come back and forth lightly. Generally speaking, when we look at it internationally, we have a state visit and an official one when our leaders visit another country. But in this case, it's a working visit. So, if we do this kind of shuttle summit or business visit, it is enough to make sure that the leaders of the two Koreas can meet more lightly and implement the agreement.  Jung Kwan-yong > I wish I could meet you from Seoul to Panmunjeom and from Pyongyang to Panmunjeom. Let me hear you through here today. Thank you. Yes, thank you.

Free Korea Party leader Hong Joon-pyo said.Hong said today (7) first sentence, Park Geun-hye, former president in the morning of writing a magazine.Information, the princess who was once loved by the nation's politics that we can make a witch, and now people frightened should be feeling the worst feelings right now.In the official residence, a president that Moon Jae-in, with the president.Hong also posted an article last night.1 won the money's there if you are reading my close acquaintances to help advise government and not be sacked and 24 years in prison for writing that the world to go to the Moon Jae-in.Boomerang of the phrase would be to the president wrote today.[anchor] organize, Park Geun-hye, former president now not because of any criminal charges, but the situation may I ended up this way, so due to political interpretation. And now, at the back of the Moon Jae-in is mentioned president, a spokesman for jeonhuigyeong. I think I said that in the same vein.[Journalist] Yes. As you said, the expression that politics can make a princess a witch can be interpreted as a form of political retaliation.But before the president is not politics is convicted, 16, on charges of bribery and say was 16 charges of misconduct.[Anchor] Right.[Journalist] But what's striking is the article by Chang Je-won.He wrote on Facebook. Now needs to be the fault of the former president about the admission of and reflection on impeachment, and gukjjeong nongdan not the Rubicon swayed by the constraints of the merits for the future.Will be focusingon the leader of the grain of awareness and showed different.[Anchor] Right. It should be at fault for the admission of and reflection on … Hong Joon-pyo was a little while ago, a position quite different from the article.[Journalist] Yes. So Jang Je-won, the spokesman, said, \" It's not an official comment, it's a personal comment.Before returning to the Liberty Korea Party, Jang strongly criticized the case at the hearing as a member of the National Assembly on the right party's manipulation of state affairs.[Anchor] So you can see. And the husband of Choi Soon-sil who caught my eye today, and what position did Jeong Yoon-hoI speak about today's first sentence?That's right. In an interview with the Dong-A Ilbo.In the interview, Jeong Yoon-hoI said, \" I didn't believe in fate when I was young, but neither he nor he or I was destined to be. \"Some interpreted it as \" Sapilgeungjeong, \" which Jeong Yoon-hoong described as fate.[Anchor] When it was not well known, it was said that Jeong Yoon-hoI was actually a heavyweight, not Choi Soon-sil. In a way, I feel like I have no choice but to have mixed emotions in the present situation. Let's take a look at the next keyword.The following keyword is 12 years if elected.[Anchor] You mean a 12-year-long, third-term second term?That's right. It was back in 1995. Once elected after the introduction of the local autonomy system, there was an area that lasted for three terms.This is the story of Ongjin County in Incheon.[Anchor] Incheon, Ongjin County?That's right. As you can see, there were only two county chiefs who won six local elections.They all went up to three lines.[Anchor] So, three lines, three X 4 12, 12 years, just two people.That's right.[Anchor] How was this possible?Ongjin County.As you can see, Ongjin County has 113 books, 23 of which are inhabited by people.[Anchor] It's almost an island, so you can see it like this.That's right. That's why you have to travel all over the 23 islands to run your campaign.But the structure of the campaign is actually a difficult one because some of the islands have to travel by ferry several times.In the case of a former county governor, he is absolutely superior in recognition because he can travel around the island for four years on the road.That means there's a separate ship in the Anchor.As for Ongjin County, as for official vehicles, there is a road line.For this reason, we talked to a member of the Incheon City Council, and Ongjin County's current premium is 100 %, not 10 % to 20 %.[Anchor] So there's a 100 percent premium for the head of the local government. So, in the end, if you reconsider it, you can go as far as three local government chiefs. So if someone wins again, we could probably do it for up to 12 years, so we could do the third line without any problems.[Journalist] That's why competition is so fierce.Currently, 10 candidates are registered as candidates for Ongjin County.Five Democrats, four Korea Party members, and one independent person.Do you have 10 anchors?[Journalist] There are 10 people, so the competitive rate is 10:1.The national average is now 5.2:1, which is double.[Anchor] Right. I heard you well. So far, I have been a reporter for the political ministry.",

Kim said, \" The trip to China and India (May 2015) was very tight to cover the official schedule, \" but one of the media reported that the car was used in the second day of the trip. \" We were looking around the temporary government building, \" Kim said.",

On the evening of the Daedong River in Pyongyang, a fifteen-minute fireworks display took place. It was in 2009 when fireworks first appeared on Kim Il Sung's birthday, and North Korea has been holding fireworks every year on Kim Il Sung's birthday since 2011.North Korean media also reported that dances by youth and students were held in Pyongyang and the provinces, and performances were staged in various places.

Police are focusing on analyzing evidence seized by Kim's office. A source from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said, \" We are analyzing various data from Kim's Paju office in Gyeonggi Province. In particular, the police secured the text message and online messenger \" Telegram \" that Kim sent to Kim and is checking whether he is related to the case. The police are checking whether any of the other suspects were involved in the crime and whether the gang attempted to manipulate public opinion in other articles.Some are raising the argument that they are plotting for the local elections. It is assumed that the election of the South Chungcheong Province governor was the reason why Kim's approach to the meeting was not only for Kim but also for other Democratic Party lawmakers. \" We believe there are more partners, \" said a police official.",

The Moon Jae-in appreciate the opportunities for dialogue in a moment of crisis. \" The most important thing is to convey our firm stance on the dismantlement of North Korean nuclear weapons at the inter-Korean summit. \" Ban is also the honorary director of Yonsei University's Global Social Contributions Association.\" It is important for me to concentrate on national sentiment and not get my heart hot, but to keep my head cool, \" Ban said. Ban said the strong alliance between South Korea and the United States and strategic talks between the U.S. and North Korea should be a framework. In particular, the government's use of \" arbitration diplomacy \" to make North Korea and the U.S. into an ambassador could have a negative impact on the Korea-U.S. relations. \" We should not pass the North Korean issue on to the U.S. as if we were intervening between North Korea and the United States, \" Ban said. Ban stressed the importance of support and cooperation from the international community and called for a wider international outlook. \" If we actively participate in and contribute to global issues instead of being buried in domestic issues, we will end up receiving international support in solving the problem, \" he stressed.Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the keynote of the inter-Korean summit, We must give the North a firm stance to dismantle the North Korean nuclear weapons in a way that is completely, verifiable and irreversible at the inter-Korean summit talks. Regarding the summit between North Korea and the United States, it would have a very negative impact if North Korea goes ahead with \" salami \" tactics as it did in the past. It`s not easy to negotiate with North Korea unless we show a firm stance even if it is difficult. The following is an interview with Ban. It seems that peace has come from a situation where people were worried about war. What do you think of the current situation? The inter-Korean summit and the first-ever U.S.-North Korean summit will likely be a landmark in world history, depending on the developments since then. Until recently, the world was worried that a war would break out, but the Winter Olympics helped solve the problem. There is a saying that when God passes the moment of history, the man who holds the collar makes history. Moon Jae-in the president think that I have a good grasp of the instrument. However, if the mountain is too high, the goal can be deep and the climate can change dramatically. As it is still difficult to predict, it is necessary to make thorough preparations.This is as important as the first and second inter-Korean summits. The agenda itself is totally different. Above all, Seoul should deliver its firm stance on dismantling the North's nuclear weapons in a completely, verifiable and irreversible manner to Pyongyang. It should also be noted that North Korea can no longer live alone, ignoring the wishes and criticisms of all nations in the international community. Inter-Korean reconciliation and economic cooperation will automatically follow when the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved. Also, the ROK-US relationship is more important now than ever. In particular, South Korea should have a basic framework for dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. Is there any way to reduce and manage domestic conflicts? There is no country without conflict. Korea has grown economically and has achieved democracy in a compressed manner. In the process, people's desires and standards were diversified. Although there are conservatives and liberals in every country politically speaking, we have too much ideological spectrum. We should stick to solving these problems. The president should quickly and security dialogue and political leader without showing people and also to communicate such activities should be a lot of. Where would you also busy, but something more important than this president scheduled. \" - Moon Jae-in government art and the North a mediating role in internationally well.Be under. However, I feel that the U.S. does not trust the government 100 percent.\" The use by a good grasp of the opportunities for the president is the door. Not only is it good for Korea but it is also good for international evaluation. South Korea international news media was very critical comments about the president is an important role in the door, he's been doing that well so far and that little consensus views. What I emphasize is that it is really important from now on. All the major players in the United States have changed. The president and successfully to the basic principles, but many Washington and Pyongyang summit a lot of unpredictable comments and Pompeii, five U.S. Secretary of State.Nominee, and national security adviser John Bolton is a very a hard-liner. It is not easy to have a strategic consultation and maintain good relations with them without any loopholes. I'm out the position of the United States media but can not be representative of Moon Jae-in, a government concerns about the same tone is felt. - What kind of concern do you feel?We tend to look at inter-Korean issues from a national perspective. It is natural because it is a divided nation. They have an absolute position to promote peaceful reconciliation and cooperation and eventually unify them. But the United States sees nuclear weapons as the most important thing. It is understandable that there is a difference in approach, but it is difficult to widen. ‘diplomatic arbitration’, but South-North Korean president, the problem is that arbitration is wrong to do a lot of wealth. \" - the expression ‘diplomatic arbitration’ is misunderstood.Is that the capital.There are two countries in the world that have been divided. Not only the Korean Peninsula but also Cyprus has been divided since 1974. As UN Secretary General, I have conducted arbitration to promote the unification of Cyprus. The two leaders were invited frequently to negotiate in a very serious manner. In Cyprus, a person is based on population and president twice and then in Northern Cyprus, or How do I configure army and police and judiciary and legislature.The ratio of national rule, and so on what to do the two leaders about the face angry over between me and I stayed up all night. Such is the way of arbitration. We must not say that we are intervening between the U.S. and North Korea. We are the parties, not the mediators. Of course, the United States has a much stronger means of solving this problem than we have. However, we should not just pass the North Korean issue on as if it were being passed on. In inter-Korean relations, North Korea continues to exclude South Korea and talk only to the United States. So we are emphasizing that Pyongyang must go through Seoul on its way to Washington. But arbitration ‘We are the problems its nuclear program, I'll Be the United States’ report from the sidelines this problem if you do this like this. \" - the government.Denuclearization at the summit as a top priority, but the Moon Jae-in, the government basically inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation has a strong will. How should we reconcile progress in inter-Korean relations with resolving the nuclear issue? The international community, including the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, has the same stance on the nuclear issue. In this regard, we should cooperate more actively with international norms and stereotypes. This is because nuclear weapons are not elsewhere, but on the Korean Peninsula. You should not let your heart warm up first because you are so focused on national feelings. There is no reason for anyone to oppose the South Korean government's desire to reconcile and cooperate with the North. If we can resolve this issue with a cool head, we can automatically resolve pending issues and tension between the two Koreas. \" Even after 25 years of negotiations for denuclearization failed, do you think it is realistic to push ahead with such issues as establishing a peace regime and normalization of relations?It is difficult, but I think it depends on how North Korea behaves. We can judge what North Korea is willing to do at the inter-Korean summit. If we start with ' salami ' as many conditions as in the past, it will have a very negative impact on the U.S.-North Korea summit. Even if it is difficult, it will be easier to negotiate with North Korea only if we show our firm stance. Otherwise, if the two Koreas meet and nothing has changed from the past, the U.S. will probably go very hard. If this happens, there is a high possibility that the U.S. and North Korean dialogue will be broken. It is worrisome, \" he said. It has become important to win international cooperation and support for the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.I am working as a member of the Elders Group, an international senior society group, and I am going to London, England to attend the Elders meeting this week. They will discuss the North Korean nuclear issue there. Presidential spokesman Kim EuI-gyeom also announced, but he recently sent a letter to the Elders ' group asking the leaders of the two Koreas, North Korea and the United States to take a good view of the historic events and resolve them well. The international environment is still very important, although the parties directly deal with the problem. If we want to be internationally supported and friendly on the Korean Peninsula, we need to turn our eyes to international issues and contribute more to the international community. What I always felt when I worked as U.N. Secretary General was that Korea's international perspective was too narrow. Instead of being buried in domestic issues, the government should actively participate in and contribute to global issues such as the U.N.'s goals for sustainable development and climate change. Such things could eventually return as a result of gaining international support in solving the Korean Peninsula problem.",
